They've chosen the music exclusively from the songbook of one writer— that would be Harris— matching up the selections with a diverse lineup of renowned performers including Willie Nelson, Feist, Bright Eyes, Emmylou Harris, The Black Keys, M. Ward, Norah Jones, Brad Mehldau and Cat Power.

When we started this project, I picked another song for him, and he said, ‘Well, I’d really like to do ‘Big Old House,\"’ which I thought was great.
