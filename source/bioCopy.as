scrollingTFabout.nextCopy("<b>JESSE HARRIS</b> (Composer)<br />With the soundtrack to the feature film The Hottest State (coming Aug. 7 on Hickory Records), singer/songwriter Jesse Harris and the movies writer, director and supporting cast member Ethan Hawke have done something completely differentand quite possibly unprecedented. Theyve chosen the music exclusively from the songbook of one writerthat would be Harrismatching up the selections with a diverse lineup of renowned performers including Willie Nelson, Feist, Bright Eyes, Emmylou Harris, The Black Keys, M. Ward, Norah Jones, Brad Mehldau and Cat Power. All are at the tops of their games on this scintillating soundtrack, which doubles as a captivating showcase for Harris songs.<br /><br />Also performing Harris songs are Argentinean newcomer Rocha who sings English and Spanish versions of the movies centerpiece, Never See You (lip-synced in the film by Oscar nominee Catalina Sandino Moreno, who plays the role of Sara), Tony Scherr, the longtime guitarist in Harris group the Ferdinandos, and Jesse himself, who steps up to the mic on three tracks. Harris also has a role in the film, playing the part of (what else?) a singer/songwriter.<br /><br />Because music would play a central role in The Hottest State, Hawke asked Harris, whom hes known since the early 90s, to write the four songs called for by the screenplay. From our first conversation, Hawke recalls, I was overwhelmed by the quality of Jesses songwriting and how perfectly matched it was to my aspirations for the tone and mood of the film. <br /><br />Harris picks up the thread: The more we talked about it, the more we thought it would be cool to score the film with different singers doing my songs. Beyond that, I would sing my own tunes as a character in the film, write the songs for the character Sara to sing and compose the instrumental score. Everything would be newly recorded for the movie. So we started getting in touch with the artists on our wish listEthan would write letters, or I would call friends and ask them, and just about everyone we contacted was enthusiastic about the idea. <br /><br />As for the artists who appear, Harris explains: Ethan really wanted Willie Nelson, and I dont think theres a songwriter out there who hasnt dreamed of having Willie sing one of his songs. Brad Mehldau got into it after I took Ethan down to the Village Vanguard to see him play; hed never heard Brad before and he was blown away. But other than that, Ethan and I just picked artists whose music we loved. <br /><br />Whats striking about this collection of material, which seems to emanate from the very wellspring of American musical expression, is how adaptable Harris music turns out to be. We really did try to match songs to artists, and pick songs for them that we felt they would sound good singing, Jesse points out. But its also a testament to these artists and what an amazing job they all did. <br /><br />Eleven of the 18 songs on the soundtrack album originally appeared on Harris albums. The exceptions are Never See You (which appears in Spanish, English and instrumental versions) and It Will Stay With Us, both of which Harris penned for the movie, and the previously written but unreleased Dear Dorothy; the collection also includes two score pieces.<br />",false, false);

Wards take on Crooked Lines, which Ward produced himself. Harris flew to Miami to capture Cat Powers performance of Its Alright to Fail, working with Terry Manning, who engineered and Jesses last two albums, Mineral (2006, Secret Sun) and While the Music Lasts (2004, Verve). Harris friends Feist and Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes handled their own recordings of Somewhere Down the Road and Big Old House, respectively, as did pianist Mehldau on his solo instrumental version of Never See You. Jesse supplied the Black Keys and Emmylou Harris with lyrics and chord changes for their selections, having no idea what approaches they would take. Emmylous version of The Speed of Sound is beautiful, he says, and the Black Keys did something totally unexpected with If You Ever Slip  they really rock it out, and I love it. <br />",false, false);

scrollingTFabout.nextCopy("<br />Hawke truly earned his executive producer credit on the soundtrack album. He was actively involved in the process of picking the songs, matching them up with particular artists and calling for particular feels for the music that would be heard in certain scenes. Ethan has great musical instincts, Jesse points out. He knew exactly what he wanted, and he was very clear about it. He even told me what instrumentation he wanted in my band: upright bass, upright pianoan old upright piano, he saiddrums, acoustic guitar. The character Sara loves country music, Johnny Cash and Lucinda Williams, and the film is set in Texas and New Mexico as well as New York, so a lot of the material was chosen to fit that vibe.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Harris describes the experience of creating the music for The Hottest State as a dream come true. Ive always wanted every one of these artists to sing songs of mine, and to have it all happen at once was just unbelievable. It was immensely gratifying and great fun from beginning to end.<br />",false,true);
